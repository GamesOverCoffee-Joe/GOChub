    "synopsisQuestions": {
      "What is the primary game design concept or theme discussed in this episode?": "Joe and I talk about Depression and how the feeling of depression is expressed in two games: Actual Sunlight and Depression Quest.",
      "What specific games are analyzed, and what aspects of their design are highlighted in relation to the main concept?": "Specifically, we talk about the empathetic mechanics of Depression Quest and how it's different from a purely sympathetic take on the same mindset in Actual Sunlight.",
      "What is the central argument or key takeaway the episode makes about game design?": "Narratives are often communicated in sympathetic ways in video games. It's easy to miss that empathetic stories can be shared via mechanics."

      "What was a notable challenge or interesting aspect during the production of this episode (e.g., research difficulty, specific editing techniques, unexpected discoveries during analysis)?": "This was the first time I did a conversation like this, with me and my plush robot, Joe. My wife named Joe, saying it was a 'cup of Joe'. Joe is a real life version of the Games Over Coffee Logo. When I first made the logo, Taylor (friend of the show) said it looked like a robot. That made me wanna make it real. Also, the reason why it begins with the words Half Caff is because that's what the show was called at the time.",
      "Were there any alternative ideas or concepts for this episode that didn't make the final cut?": "I made a concept episode to test out how this conversation would work. It's posted in my Patreon section of the discord. I played with the idea that I would annoy Joe because I wanted to talk about game design all the time.",
